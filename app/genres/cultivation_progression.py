Use {pronouns} pronouns for {character_name}.

{origin_prompt}{big_goal_prompt}

ðŸ”‘ **MANDATORY STORY CLARITY RULES (Every Chapter MUST fulfill):**

1. **Clear Logical Sequence**:
   - Every event and action MUST have a logical cause-and-effect relationship clearly shown visually.
   - Explicitly describe how {character_name} moves from one location or situation to another logically and visually.

2. **Meaningful Payoff**:
   - When {character_name} completes a challenge or test, explicitly provide a clear, tangible reward or clear meaningful consequence.
   - Rewards must be visually and narratively clear (e.g., clearly described new cultivation techniques, breakthrough insights, powerful artifacts, allies, cultivation advancement).

3. **Clear Motivation & Intention**:
   - Clearly explain character motivations and dialogue context visually or through internal thought.
   - Do NOT use repetitive cryptic dialogues ("prove your worth") without explicitly clarifying what this means in the current cultivation situation.

4. **Explicit Scene Continuity**:
   - Clearly and logically transition from one chapter scene to the next, explicitly describing where {character_name} is and why they moved there.

ðŸš« **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN (Do NOT do this):**
- Unexplained scene transitions or location changes.
- Vague rewards or unclear outcomes after cultivation challenges.
- Repetitive cryptic dialogue without explicit clarity or meaningful context.
- Actions or outcomes that confuse readers about what exactly happened.

---

### ðŸ“Œ MANDATORY STORY OBJECTIVES (Every Chapter MUST creatively fulfill ALL):

1. **Dynamic Scene Intro:**  
   - Set a clear visual location, mood, and initial action. Avoid generic or repetitive setups.

2. **Character Focus (Main character: {character_name}):**  
   - Clearly show personality via unique action or dialogue.
   - Clearly portray cultivation level or emotional state naturally.

3. **Engaging Conflict or Mystery:**  
   - Introduce a creative, unpredictable conflict, mystery, or challenge.
   - Conflict should NOT always be a rival discipleâ€”vary situations (environmental, internal struggle, mysterious entity, mentor/student, political intrigue).

4. **Visual Cultivation Showcase:**  
   - Explicitly name and visually describe at least one cultivation technique.
   - Clearly describe Qi visually (colors, patterns, sensory effects).

5. **Believable Character Interactions:**  
   - Dialogue short (max 15 words per bubble), natural, emotionally expressive.
   - Characters must clearly reflect their personalities and motivations.

6. **Clear Consequences & Progression:**  
   - Visually show immediate consequences or reactions logically following events.
   - Ensure clear character growth, setbacks, or meaningful story shifts.

7. **Intriguing Ending:**  
   - End chapter visually and narratively intriguing, prompting curiosity or anticipation for next chapter.

---

### ðŸ“š CREATIVE GUIDELINES (To ensure freshness and unpredictability):

- Vary conflict types significantly (environmental disasters, internal character struggles, new mentor lessons, unexpected ally arrivals, ancient secrets).
- Introduce unexpected twists or revelations occasionally (hidden identities, secret missions, lost techniques).
- Characters should have clear personal motivations and unique speech patterns or habits.
- Avoid repetitive trope usage (same rival encounter repeatedly, identical training sequences).
- Leverage sensory details (sound, sight, touch) to vividly engage readers visually and emotionally.

---

### ðŸš« STRICTLY AVOID (To ensure creative storytelling):

- Predictable panel sequences or repetitive scenario setups.
- Overused clichÃ©s ("Rival shows up, mocks hero").
- Vague or abstract storytelling ("mysterious power" without specifics).
- Sudden unexplained character or event introductions.

---

### ðŸ”‘ MANDATORY RULES FOR CHOICE GENERATION:
At the conclusion of this chapter, clearly present exactly three visually distinctive and engaging manga/manhwa-style choices naturally arising directly from the current scenario and context.

For EACH CHOICE clearly provide:
- A vivid, visual, and concise description of exactly what {character_name} will do next.
- Clearly indicate how each choice logically connects and progresses from the immediate events just shown.
- Make each choice clearly unique, offering distinctly different narrative possibilities.

### ðŸŽŒ CREATIVITY REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
- Choices must naturally match the current chapter's tone, situation, and character's personality.
- Avoid overly repetitive or predictable patterns.
- Use intriguing visual and sensory details to make each choice appealing.

### ðŸš« STRICTLY FORBIDDEN IN CHOICES:
- Generic labels (do NOT say "aggressive," "strategic," or "risky/curious").
- Repetitive or vague wording ("fight aggressively," "plan strategically," "explore curiously").
- Abstract or unrelated actions not clearly tied to the current story scenario.

Now, explicitly generate these three compelling, visually engaging choices directly connected to the scene you've created.
