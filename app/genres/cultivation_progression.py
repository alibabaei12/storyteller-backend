üéå MANGA/MANHWA STORYTELLING APPROACH:
- Create 4-7 visually sequential panels (your creative choice)
- Each panel flows naturally to tell a compelling story
- Use manga/manhwa pacing: dynamic, visual, emotionally engaging
- Concise dialogue under 15 words per speech bubble
- Clear visual context and logical panel progression

CHARACTER ORIGIN INTEGRATION:
{origin_prompt}

üéØ MANDATORY STORYTELLING GOALS FOR THIS SCENE:
1. Visually introduce {character_name}, establishing personality through dynamic action
2. Clearly show {character_name}'s immediate cultivation goal or aspiration  
3. Present compelling initial conflict, challenge, or intriguing event demanding action
4. Introduce at least one supporting character (rival, master, fellow disciple) naturally
5. Showcase at least one visually distinctive, clearly named cultivation technique
6. End with intriguing cliffhanger or visually clear suspense that prompts curiosity

üî• CULTIVATION WORLD REQUIREMENTS:
- CREATIVE SECT NAMES: "Thousand Stars Sect", "Iron Will Academy", "Shifting Sands Order"
- SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES: "Shattered Earth Palm", "Whisper Step", "Molten Forge Breathing"  
- CLEAR STAGES: Qi Gathering 1-9 ‚Üí Foundation Building ‚Üí Core Formation
- VISUAL QI: Specific colors (crimson spirals, violet mist, silver threads) with unique effects
- SECT HIERARCHY: Outer ‚Üí Inner ‚Üí Core Disciple ‚Üí Elder shown naturally
- CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS: Fresh, specific goals beyond generic "get stronger"

‚úÖ CREATIVE STORYTELLING RULES:
- YOU decide optimal number of panels (4-7) for best story flow
- Each panel adds meaningful story progression, avoiding redundancy
- Dialogue reveals distinct character personalities and motivations
- Visual descriptions help readers imagine manga panels clearly
- Logical continuity between panels with creative surprises

‚ùå STRICTLY AVOID:
- Predictable storytelling clich√©s (generic rival encounters, basic training scenes)
- Abstract descriptions ("mysterious power" without specifics)
- Generic sect names (Azure/Jade/Golden/Cloud/Sky/Heaven)
- Forced panel structures that limit creativity
- Dead parents motivation (overused trope)

üéØ YOUR CREATIVE MISSION:
Create a compelling opening scene that accomplishes these storytelling goals through 4-7 dynamic panels (you choose the optimal number for best narrative flow):

üìö MANDATORY STORYTELLING GOALS:
1. **Character Introduction**: Visually introduce {character_name}, establishing their personality through a dynamic cultivation action or moment
2. **Cultivation Aspiration**: Clearly show {character_name}'s immediate cultivation goal, challenge, or what they're striving for
3. **Compelling Conflict**: Present an intriguing conflict, challenge, or event that demands immediate attention or curiosity
4. **Supporting Character**: Introduce at least one other character naturally (rival, master, fellow disciple, sect member)
5. **Technique Showcase**: Demonstrate at least one clearly named, visually distinctive cultivation technique with specific qi effects
6. **Suspenseful Ending**: End with a cliffhanger, mystery, or visually clear tension that makes readers eager for more

üåü CULTIVATION WORLD ELEMENTS TO WEAVE IN:
- **Creative Sect**: Use imaginative sect name (avoid Azure/Jade/Golden - try "Thousand Stars Sect", "Shifting Sands Order")
- **Specific Techniques**: Named techniques like "Ember Palm", "Whisper Step", "Iron Will Breathing"
- **Clear Progression**: Show {character_name}'s current stage (Qi Gathering 3, Foundation Building 1, etc.)
- **Visual Qi**: Specific colors and effects (crimson spirals, violet mist, silver threads)
- **Sect Hierarchy**: Natural inclusion of ranks (Outer/Inner/Core Disciple, Elder)
- **Fresh Motivation**: Give {character_name} a specific, compelling reason for cultivation beyond generic "get stronger"

üé® CREATIVE STORYTELLING APPROACH:
- **Panel Flow**: Create 4-7 panels that flow naturally like a real manga chapter
- **Visual Clarity**: Each panel should be imaginable as a clear manga panel with specific character positioning
- **Dialogue Style**: Concise speech bubbles under 15 words that reveal character personality
- **Pacing**: Build narrative tension naturally, avoiding predictable formulaic progression

‚ùå AVOID THESE CLICH√âS:
- Generic rival encounters that feel forced
- Predictable "mysterious master appears" scenarios  
- Basic training montages without personality
- Abstract cultivation descriptions without specifics
- Overly familiar sect politics without fresh angles
