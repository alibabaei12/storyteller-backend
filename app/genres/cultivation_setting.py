You will create a compelling, unpredictable chapter for an interactive cultivation manga. The chapter length is flexible (4â€“8 panels). Organize panels in the most visually interesting, logical, and emotionally impactful sequence possible.

## 1. Role & Story Setup.
Use {pronouns} pronouns for {character_name}.
**Story Style/Genre:** {style} - Ensure every aspect of the chapter (plot, character interactions, conflict, mood) aligns perfectly with this genre.

{origin_prompt} {big_goal_prompt}
You are currently embarking on the **initial arc** of {character_name}'s grand journey. The immediate objective for this arc is: **{initial_arc_goal}**. Every chapter within this arc should contribute directly to achieving this specific arc goal.


ðŸ”‘ **MANDATORY STORY CLARITY RULES (Every Chapter MUST fulfill):**

1. **Clear Logical Sequence**:
   - Every event and action MUST have a logical cause-and-effect relationship clearly shown visually.
   - Explicitly describe how {character_name} moves from one location or situation to another logically and visually.

2. **Meaningful Payoff**:
   - When {character_name} completes a challenge or test, explicitly provide a clear, tangible reward or clear meaningful consequence.
   - Rewards must be visually and narratively clear (e.g., clearly described new cultivation techniques, breakthrough insights, powerful artifacts, allies, cultivation advancement).

3. **Clear Motivation & Intention**:
   - Clearly explain character motivations and dialogue context visually or through internal thought.
   - Do NOT use repetitive cryptic dialogues ("prove your worth") without explicitly clarifying what this means in the current cultivation situation.

4. **Explicit Scene Continuity**:
   - Clearly and logically transition from one chapter scene to the next, explicitly describing where {character_name} is and why they moved there.

5. **Origin Integration**:
   - The **{origin_prompt}** must be actively reflected and demonstrated through {character_name}'s actions, thoughts, problem-solving approaches, and interactions within the chapter. It should directly influence the plot's progression or a key moment.


ðŸš« **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN (Do NOT do this):**
- Unexplained scene transitions or location changes.
- Vague rewards or unclear outcomes after cultivation challenges.
- Repetitive cryptic dialogue without explicit clarity or meaningful context.
- Actions or outcomes that confuse readers about what exactly happened.

---

### ðŸ“Œ MANDATORY STORY OBJECTIVES (Every Chapter MUST creatively fulfill ALL):

1. **Dynamic Scene Intro:**  
   - Set a clear visual location, mood, and initial action. Avoid generic or repetitive setups.The mood and initial action must be consistent with the **{style}** genre.

2. **Character Focus (Main character: {character_name}):**  
   - Clearly show personality via unique action or dialogue.
   - Clearly portray cultivation level or emotional state naturally.

3. **Engaging Conflict or Mystery:**  
   - The description should specify: "Introduce a creative, unpredictable conflict, mystery, or challenge that directly contributes to the {initial_arc_goal}. The conflict or mystery must be characteristic of the {style} genre.

   - Explicitly name and visually describe at least one cultivation technique.
   - Clearly describe Qi visually (colors, patterns, sensory effects).

   - Ensure clear character growth, setbacks, or meaningful story shifts that propel {character_name} towards the {initial_arc_goal}.

7. **Intriguing Ending:**  
   - End chapter visually and narratively intriguing, prompting curiosity or anticipation for next chapter, Setting up next step in current arc

---

### ðŸ“š CREATIVE GUIDELINES (To ensure freshness and unpredictability):

- Vary conflict types significantly (environmental disasters, internal character struggles, new mentor lessons, unexpected ally arrivals, ancient secrets, new test or tornoment) while staying true to the overall tone and typical scenarios of the {style} genre.".
- Introduce unexpected twists or revelations occasionally (hidden identities, secret missions, lost techniques) that serve the current arc's progression
- Characters should have clear personal motivations and unique speech patterns or habits.
- Avoid repetitive trope usage (same rival encounter repeatedly, identical training sequences).
- Leverage sensory details (sound, sight, touch) to vividly engage readers visually and emotionally.

---

### ðŸš« STRICTLY AVOID (To ensure creative storytelling):

- Predictable panel sequences or repetitive scenario setups.
- Overused clichÃ©s ("Rival shows up, mocks hero").
- Vague or abstract storytelling ("mysterious power" without specifics).
- Sudden unexplained character or event introductions.
- Introducing a new overarching story problem or concluding a major arc within a single chapter.
- Making chocies look like they are the continuation of the story
- Using explicit "Panel X:" labels. Each panel should only be preceded by '---' on a new line.


---

### ðŸ”‘ MANDATORY RULES FOR CHOICE GENERATION:
At the conclusion of this chapter, clearly present exactly three visually distinctive and engaging manga/manhwa-style choices naturally arising directly from the current scenario and context. These choices should move {character_name} forward within the current arc (working towards {initial_arc_goal}).

For EACH CHOICE clearly provide:
- A vivid, visual, and concise description of the action {character_name} will take. (Do NOT start with "{character_name} decides to..." or similar phrasing.)
- Clearly indicate how each choice logically connects and progresses from the immediate events just shown.
- Make each choice clearly unique, offering distinctly different narrative possibilities.
- Each choice has to be inside of the [CHOICES] section.

### ðŸŽŒ CREATIVITY REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
- Choices must naturally match the current chapter's tone, situation, and character's personality and  must be consistent with the overarching {style} genre."
- Avoid overly repetitive or predictable patterns.
- Use intriguing visual and sensory details to make each choice appealing.

### ðŸš« STRICTLY FORBIDDEN IN CHOICES:
- Generic labels (do NOT say "aggressive," "strategic," or "risky/curious").
- Repetitive or vague wording ("fight aggressively," "plan strategically," "explore curiously").
- Abstract or unrelated actions not clearly tied to the current story scenario.
- Choices that jump to the conclusion of the arc or a new major storyline.
- Starting a choice description with phrases like "{character_name} decides to...", "{character_name} chooses to...", or "{character_name} opts to...".
- Including choice prompts or choice options within the [STORY] section. 

Now, explicitly generate these three compelling, visually engaging choices directly connected to the scene you've created.
