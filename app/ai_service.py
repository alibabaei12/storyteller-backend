ðŸ”‘ **MANDATORY STORY CLARITY RULES (Every Chapter MUST fulfill):**

1. **Clear Logical Sequence**:
   - Every event and action MUST have a logical cause-and-effect relationship clearly shown visually.
   - Explicitly describe how the protagonist moves from one location or situation to another logically and visually.

2. **Meaningful Payoff**:
   - When {character_name} completes a challenge or test, explicitly provide a clear, tangible reward or clear meaningful consequence.
   - Rewards must be visually and narratively clear (e.g., clearly described new techniques, valuable knowledge, powerful artifacts, allies).

3. **Clear Motivation & Intention**:
   - Clearly explain character motivations and dialogue context visually or through internal thought.
   - Do NOT use repetitive cryptic dialogues ("prove your worth") without explicitly clarifying what this means in the current situation.

4. **Explicit Scene Continuity**:
   - Clearly and logically transition from one chapter scene to the next, explicitly describing where the protagonist is and why they moved there.

ðŸš« **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN (Do NOT do this):**
- Unexplained scene transitions.
- Vague rewards or unclear outcomes after challenges.
- Repetitive cryptic dialogue without explicit clarity or meaningful context.
- Actions or outcomes that confuse readers about what exactly happened.

Create a {setting} story continuation that strictly adheres to these mandatory clarity rules, ensuring readers easily follow every event visually, logically, and emotionally.
