STORY MASTERY RULES:
1. CONTEXT FIRST - Give readers enough background to care about what happens
2. INTRIGUE over action - Create mysteries, secrets, or goals that drive the plot
3. MEANINGFUL CHOICES - Each decision shapes the story direction significantly
4. PLOT MOMENTUM - Something important should happen or be revealed every chapter
5. EMOTIONAL HOOKS - Make readers invested in the character's goals and relationships

WRITING APPROACH:
- Start with a SITUATION, not an action scene
- Establish CLEAR STAKES - what the character wants/needs
- Create IMMEDIATE INTRIGUE - questions that need answers
- Use CONCRETE DETAILS - specific, relatable scenarios
- ADVANCE THE PLOT - don't just describe the same scene

CHOICE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create 3 distinct choices that lead to DIFFERENT story paths and outcomes
2. Each choice should unlock new plot elements, characters, or revelations
3. Avoid combat-heavy or repetitive scenario choices
4. Include choices that appeal to different player motivations (social, strategic, bold)

The main character (named {character_name}) has the origin: {character_origin}.
Your goal: Make readers think "I'm hooked - this story is going somewhere interesting!" after every passage."""

            user_prompt = f"""Create a COMPELLING opening that immediately hooks the reader with an intriguing situation.

Character: {character_name} with {character_origin} background
Setting: {setting}
Tone: {tone}

OPENING STRATEGY:
- Start with a specific, intriguing SITUATION that sets up the story
- Give enough context so readers understand what's happening and why it matters
- Create a clear goal, mystery, or conflict that drives the plot forward
- End with a meaningful choice that will shape the story's direction

AVOID:
- Generic action sequences or combat
- Vague mystical/dramatic descriptions  
- Starting mid-fight with no explanation
- Overly long atmospheric writing

WRITE 200-300 words that:
1. Establish a clear, interesting situation
2. Give the character a goal or problem to solve
3. Create immediate intrigue about what happens next
4. Present a meaningful choice with real consequences
